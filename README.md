## Description  
Valorant Hub is a website built for fans and players of [translate:Valorant], Riot Games’ tactical first-person shooter that’s taken the gaming world by storm. Our goal is to gather all the important info—agents, weapons, maps, and esports news—in one easy place so players, whether casual or competitive, can get better at the game. We want to help you understand gameplay mechanics, keep up-to-date with the latest patches and tournaments, and improve strategies with clear, useful tips.  
The design is inspired by Valorant’s sleek in-game interface, so browsing the site feels like checking out an official terminal from inside the game. We focus on making everything really organized and simple to navigate, so whether you want to learn about agent abilities, compare guns, study map callouts, or catch esports highlights, it’s all right at your fingertips.

## Topic Outline  

### Home Page  
This is where users first land and get introduced to what Valorant Hub is all about. It sets the tone with a bold banner and gives quick previews of the main areas—Agents, Weapons, Maps, and Esports—through clickable boxes. Our goal here is to make navigation super clear so users can easily dive into any section of the site from the start.

### Agents Page  
This page displays all the playable agents grouped by their specific roles like Duelist, Controller, Initiator, or Sentinel. Each agent profile features eye-catching visuals, key background info, and practical tips to help players choose characters that fit their style or learn counter-tactics. This helps new and veteran players better understand the strengths and how to use or counter each agent in matches.

### Weapons Page  
Here, players can browse Valorant’s full arsenal, sorted neatly by categories like Rifles, SMGs, Snipers, Sidearms, and Shotguns. Each weapon has its picture, detailed stats, and guides that explain when and how best to use it. This page is perfect for helping players pick their loadout according to their gameplay style or economy management during matches.

### Maps Page  
The Maps page features official maps used in both normal games and competitive tournaments. It breaks down important callouts, strategic areas, and suggests agent picks for each map, helping players get familiar with layouts and plan their team strategies better. This section aims to boost players’ map knowledge for climbing ranks and dominating in tactical gameplay.

### Esports Page  
On the Esports page, users get up-to-date coverage of major tournaments like [translate:VCT Masters] and [translate:Champions]. We also highlight the top teams of 2025 and showcase key match highlights and news from the global competitive scene. This page keeps Valorant fans connected to the pro circuit and major events all year round.

## JavaScript Integration  
To make Valorant Hub feel more alive and easy to use, we’ll use JavaScript for various interactive features throughout the site. For example, on the Agents Page, JS will let users filter agents by their roles without needing to reload the page. You just click on Duelist or Controller, and the page instantly updates to show only those agents.  
On the Weapons Page, JavaScript helps sort weapons by category and shows cool animations when you hover over them, revealing stats clearly.  
The Esports Page will have a live update section powered by JS that automatically cycles through the latest matches and highlights so users always get fresh content without clicking or refreshing.  

We’ll put the JavaScript either inside the HTML files near the bottom or in separate files linked properly to make sure the site loads fast and runs smoothly. This setup keeps everything neat and makes it easier to update later. Overall, JavaScript makes the Valorant Hub feel more like the real game—fast, tactical, and engaging.
